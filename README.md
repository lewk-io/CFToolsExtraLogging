# CFTools Extra Logging
A server side mod to enable some extra logging in CFTools.
Currently all additional logs use CFTools' interaction api, this means all extra logs will appear as "base building".

## Logged functions:

### Vanilla
Action | Function | Description
-|-|-
'has connected' | `MissionServer InvokeOnConnect()` | Logs when a player has finished connecting. CFTools' default log will be when a player initiates joining (so they're in the loading screen). This log fires when the player has finished loading.
'is disconnecting' | `MissionServer OnClientDisconnectedEvent()` | Logs when a player starts disconnecting (if they press escape > exit). If the player presses ALT+F4, then this message will appear followed by a 'left' message.
'has disconnected' | `MissionServer InvokeOnDisconnect()` | Logs when a player has waited through the log out time and disconected. If a player presses alt+f4 after they have started disconnecting, you will not see this log. Note: This log will be when the player has disconnected from the server, CFTools's default "left" message will occur when their character has been despawned.
